# Managing_Social_Media_Accounts
As a part of my internship at TalentServe, I made this Project where employee can fill their social media details on the website and this data will be stored in the company database. Whenever the Admin needs to look at their Social Media Profile, the admin will simply open the second website and just click on the respective logo in the Emp profile.
